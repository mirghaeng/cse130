- dog.c   
	This file contains the code for the program that reads file data or standard input to standard output. In order to test the program, we used the diff command to check for any differences between the cat command and our ./dog command. We also tested our commands with different types of files such as txt and binary files to make sure it worked for all types.       
- Makefile    
	The Makefile creates the object file and the executable for dog.c. We also included a clean function to remove these files.    
- DESIGN.pdf    
	Our design document explains the functions used in the dog.c program.   
- README.md    
	This README contains information on all of the files in the assignment.
